## Hi there 👋
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher (Bioinformatics) building scalable genomics pipelines for genome assembly, variant discovery, and population-scale analysis.

## About me!

•	Extensive experience with short-read (Illumina) and long-read DNA & RNA sequencing including PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore, and Iso-Seq
•	Strong background in de novo and reference-guided genome assembly, pan-genomics, GWAS, transcriptomics, and population genomics
•	Skilled in designing automated, scalable, and reproducible pipelines using Python, R, Shell scripting, and Snakemake
•	Hands-on expertise in genome scaffolding (Hi-C, RagTag) and annotation workflows (BRAKER, Helixer)
•	Proficient with widely used bioinformatics tools including BWA, Minimap2, GATK, SAMtools, BCFtools, BEDTools, and TASSEL
•	Strong foundation in molecular biology and sequencing workflows, enabling deeper biological interpretation of genomic data
•	Passionate about building efficient, reproducible, and scalable bioinformatics solutions to solve complex biological problems
